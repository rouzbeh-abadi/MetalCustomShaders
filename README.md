# MetalCustomShaders

MetalCustomShaders is a repository containing custom Metal shaders for image processing and filtering. These shaders leverage the power of Metal, Apple's low-level graphics and compute API, to perform various operations on images such as grayscale conversion, edge detection, and saturation adjustment.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the concepts and techniques covered in this repository, make sure to check out the accompanying Medium article titled ["Building Custom Shaders with Metal"](https://medium.com/@JustRouzbeh/building-custom-shaders-with-metal-854aae65458). In this article, the process of crafting and utilizing custom shaders using Metal is explored in detail. It provides step-by-step guidance, explanations, and practical examples to help you grasp the core concepts and techniques involved.


## Repository Images

In this repository, you will find the following images that demonstrate the output of the custom Metal shaders:

![Derivatives](Images/Derivatives.png)

This image showcases the output of the image derivatives operation performed using a custom Metal shader. The derivatives are calculated for each pixel in the image, highlighting the edges and providing valuable information for edge detection and image segmentation.

![Saturation](Images/Saturation.png)

This image demonstrates the effect of the saturation adjustment operation achieved using a custom Metal shader. By modifying the saturation of the colors in an image, this operation allows for vibrant or desaturated visual effects, providing greater control over the image's color intensity.
